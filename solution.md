 **Generalized Epilepsy** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_epilepsy)  and **Myoclonic Seizures** [T184] ()  in **22q11.2** [T047] ()  **Deletion Syndrome** [T047] ()  Prompted by the observations of **juvenile myoclonic epilepsy** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_myoclonic_epilepsy)  ( **JME** [T047] ()  ) in **22q11.2** [T047] ()  **deletion syndrome** [T047] ()  ( **22q11DS** [T047] ()  ) and recurrent copy number variants in **genetic generalized epilepsy** [T047] ()  ( **GGE** [T047] ()  ) , we searched for further evidence supporting a possible correlation of **22q11DS** [T047] ()  with **GGE** [T047] ()  and with **myoclonic seizures** [T184] ()  . Through routine **diagnostics** [T060]  , we identified 3 novel individuals with the seemingly uncommon combination of **22q11DS** [T047] ()  and **JME** [T047] ()  . We subsequently screened the literature for reports focussing on the **epilepsy** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy)  phenotype in **22q11DS** [T047] ()  . We additionally screened a database of 173 **22q11DS** [T047] ()  patients and identified a fourth individual with **JME** [T047] ()  as well as 2 additional cases with **GGE** [T047] ()  . We describe 6 novel and 22 published cases with co - occurrence of **22q11DS** [T047] ()  and **GGE** [T047] ()  . In many patients , **GGE** [T047] ()  was associated with **myoclonic seizures** [T184] ()  allowing for a **diagnosis** [T033]  of **JME** [T047] ()  in at least 6 individuals . Seventeen of the 173 **22q11DS** [T047] ()  cases ( 10 % ) had a **diagnosis** [T033]  of either **focal** [T047] ()  or **generalized epilepsy** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_epilepsy)  . In these cases , **focal epilepsy** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_seizure)  could often be attributed to **syndrome - associated** [T047] ()  **hypocalcaemia** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocalcemia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocalcemia)  , **cerebral bleeds** [T047] ()  , or **structural brain anomalies** [T019]  . However , the cause of **GGE** [T047] ()  remained **unclear** [T033]  . In this study , we describe and review 28 individuals with **22q11DS** [T047] ()  and **GGE** [T047] ()  ( especially **JME** [T047] ()  ) , showing that both **disorders** [T047] ()  frequently co - occur . Compared to the reported prevalence of 15 - 21 % , in our case series only 10 % of **22q11DS** [T047] ()  individuals were found to have **epilepsy** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy)  , often **GGE** [T047] ()  . Since 22q11.2 does not contain convincing **GGE** [T047] ()  candidate genes , we discuss the possibility of an aetiological correlation through a possibly disturbed interaction with the GABAB receptor .

 The Histone Acetyltransferase Gcn5 Positively Regulates T Cell Activation Histone acetyltransferases ( HATs ) regulate inducible transcription in multiple cellular processes and during inflammatory and immune response . However , the functions of general control nonrepressed - protein 5 ( Gcn5 ) , an evolutionarily conserved HAT from yeast to human , in immune regulation remain unappreciated . In this study , we conditionally deleted Gcn5 ( encoded by the Kat2a gene ) specifically in T lymphocytes by crossing floxed Gcn5 and Lck - Cre mice , and demonstrated that Gcn5 plays important roles in multiple stages of T cell functions including development , clonal expansion , and differentiation . Loss of Gcn5 functions impaired T cell proliferation , IL-2 production , and Th1 / Th17 , but not Th2 and regulatory T cell differentiation . Gcn5 is recruited onto the il-2 promoter by interacting with the NFAT in T cells upon TCR stimulation . Interestingly , instead of directly acetylating NFAT , Gcn5 catalyzes histone H3 lysine H9 acetylation to promote IL-2 production . T cell -specific suppression of Gcn5 partially protected mice from myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein - induced **experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis** [T050]  , an experimental model for human **multiple sclerosis** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis)  . Our study reveals previously unknown physiological functions for Gcn5 and a molecular mechanism underlying these functions in regulating T cell immunity . Hence Gcn5 may be an important new target for **autoimmune disease therapy** [T047] ()  .

 Effects of **soybean isoflavone** [T121]  on **intestinal** [T023]  antioxidant capacity and cytokines in young piglets fed oxidized fish oil To investigate the effect of glycitein , a synthetic **soybean isoflavone** [T121]  ( **ISF** [T121]  ) , on the **intestinal** [T023]  antioxidant capacity , morphology , and cytokine content in young piglets fed oxidized fish oil , 72 4 - d - old male piglets were assigned to three treatments . The control group was fed a basal diet containing fresh fish oil , and the other two groups received the same diet except for the **substitution** [T061]  with the same dosage of oxidized fish oil alone or with **ISF** [T121]  ( oxidized fish oil plus **ISF** [T121]  ) . After 21 d of feeding , **supplementation** [T061]  of oxidized fish oil increased the levels of malondialdehyde ( MDA ) , oxidized glutathione ( GSSG ) , interleukin-1β ( IL-1β ) , tumor necrosis factor - α ( TNF - α ) , interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) , nuclear factor κ B ( NF - κB ) , inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) , **NO** [T121]  , and Caspase-3 in jejunal mucosa , and decreased the villous height in **duodenum** [T023]  and the levels of secretory immunoglobulin A ( sIgA ) and IL-4 in the jejunal mucosa compared with supplementation with fresh oil . The addition of oxidized fish oil plus **ISF** [T121]  partially alleviated this **negative** [T033]  effect . The addition of oxidized **negative fish oil** [T033]  plus **ISF** [T121]  increased the villous height and levels of sIgA and IL-4 in jejunal mucosa , but decreased the levels of IL-1β and IL-2 in jejunal mucosa ( P<0.05 ) compared with oxidized fish oil . Collectively , these results show that dietary supplementation of **ISF** [T121]  could partly alleviate the **negative** [T033]  effect of oxidized fish oil by improving the **intestinal** [T023]  morphology as well as the antioxidant capacity and immune function in young piglets .

 **Preclinical fibrinolysis** [T061]  in patients with **ST - segment elevation myocardial infarction** [T047] ()  in a rural region In the current guidelines for the **treatment** [T061]  of patients with **ST - segment elevation myocardial infarction** [T047] ()  ( **STEMI** [T047] ()  ) , the European Society of Cardiology ( ESC ) recommends preclinical **STEMI fibrinolysis** [T047] ()  as a **reperfusion therapy** [T061]  if , due to long transportation times , no **cardiac catheterisation** [T058]  is available within 90 - 120 min . However , there is little remaining in - depth expertise in this method because **fibrinolysis** [T060]  is presently only **fibrinolysis rarely indicated** [T060]  . In a rural area in southwestern Germany , where an emergency **primary percutaneous coronary intervention** [T061]  was not routinely available within 90 - 120 min , 156 **STEMI** [T047] ()  patients underwent **fibrinolysis** [T060]  with the **plasminogen activator reteplase** [T121]  , performed by trained emergency physicians . The practicality of the **treatment** [T061]  , as well as complications and the mortality of the patients in the preclinical phase until arrival at the hospital , were retrospectively studied . The mean time from onset of the **symptoms** [T184] ()  to first medical contact was 114 ± 116 min . The mean interval to the start of **fibrinolysis** [T061]  of 13.5 ± 6.4 min was within the 30 min mandated by the ESC . Patients with **inferior STEMI** [T047] ()  represented the largest subgroup . Occurring in 39 cases ( 25 % ) , complications due to **infarction** [T047] ()  were relatively common during the prehospital phase , including 15 cases ( 9.6 % ) of cardiogenic shock , but in all cases the complications were manageable . No patient died before arrival at the hospital . As **lysis** [T061]  - associated adverse effects , merely two uncomplicated mucosal haemorrhages and one case of mild **allergic** [T184] ()  skin reactions were seen . In emergency situations with long transportation times to the nearest suitable cardiac catheterisation laboratory , **preclinical fibrinolysis** [T061]  in **STEMI** [T047] ()  still represents a workable method . Success of this strategy requires particularly strong training of the emergency physicians in **ECG** [T033]  and **lysis therapy** [T061]  , and co - operation with nearby cardiac centres .

 How should proxies of cognitive reserve be **evaluated** [T058]  in a population of healthy older adults ? While some tools have been developed to estimate an individual 's cognitive reserve ( CR ) , no study has assessed the adequacy of the method used for **assessing** [T058]  these CR proxy indicators . Therefore , we aimed to determine the most appropriate method to estimate CR by comparing two approaches : ( 1 ) the common **assessment** [T058]  of CR proxies in the literature ( e.g. years of education ) and ( 2 ) the calculation of a comprehensive index based on most significant **parameters** [T033]  used in the estimation of CR . Data on CR proxies ( i.e. education , occupation , and leisure activities ) were obtained in a sample of 204 older adults . Regression analyses were used to develop the two indices of CR ( i.e. ICR - standard and ICR - detailed ) and to determine which index best represented the level of one 's CR . The ICR - standard was calculated using a combination of the three most common measures of reserve in the literature : number of schooling years , complexity of the primary occupation , and amount of current participation in stimulating activities . The ICR - detailed was calculated using the most significant parameters ( established in initial analyses ) of CR : highest level of education combined with the number of training courses , last occupation , and amount of current participation in social and intellectual activities . The comparison of both indices showed that higher levels of ICR - standard and ICR - detailed were associated with a greater minimization of the effects of age on cognition . However , the ICR - detailed was more strongly associated to this minimization than the ICR - standard , suggesting that the ICR - detailed best reflect one 's CR . This study is the first to show that it is of great importance to question methods measuring CR proxies in order to develop a clinical tool allowing a comprehensive and accurate estimation of CR .

 Identification of potential predictive markers of **dexamethasone** [T121]  resistance in childhood **acute lymphoblastic leukemia** [T191]  Response to **dexamethasone** [T121]  ( **DEXA** [T121]  ) , as a hallmark **drug** [T121]  in the **treatment** [T061]  of childhood **acute lymphoblastic leukemia** [T191]  ( **ALL** [T191]  ) , is one of the pivotal prognostic factors in the prediction of outcome in **ALL** [T191]  . Identification of predictive markers of chemoresistance is beneficial to selecting of the best **therapeutic protocol** [T061]  with the lowest effect adverse . Hence , we aimed to find drug targets using the **2DE / MS proteomics** [T059]  study of a **DEXA** [T121]  - resistant cell line ( REH ) as a model for poor **DEXA** [T121]  responding patients before and after **drug treatment** [T061]  . Using the **proteomic methods** [T059]  , three differentially expressed proteins were detected , including voltage dependent anion channel 1 ( VDAC1 ) , sorting Nexin 3 ( SNX3 ) , and prefoldin subunit 6 ( PFDN6 ) . We observed low expression of three proteins after **DEXA** [T121]  treatment in REH cells . We subsequently verified low expression of resulted proteins at the mRNA level using the **quantitative PCR method** [T059]  . These proteins are promising proteins because of their important roles in drug resistance and regulation of apoptosis ( VDAC1 ) , protein trafficking ( SNX3 ) , and protein folding ( PFDN6 ) . Additionally , mRNA expression level of these proteins was assessed in 17 bone marrow samples from children with newly diagnosed **ALL** [T191]  and 7 non - cancerous samples as controls . The results indicated that independent of the molecular subtypes of **leukemia** [T191]  , mRNA expression of VDAC1 , SNX3 , and PFDN6 decreased in **ALL** [T191]  samples compared with non - cancerous samples particularly in VDAC1 ( p < 0.001 ) . Additionally , mRNA expression of three proteins was also declined in **high - risk** [T033]  samples compared with **standard risk** [T033]  cases . These results demonstrated diagnostic and prognostic value of these proteins in **childhood ALL** [T191]  . Furthermore , investigation of protein - protein interaction using STRING database indicated that these proteins involved in the signaling pathway of NR3C1 as **dexamethasone** [T121]  target . In conclusion , our **proteomic study** [T059]  in **DEXA** [T121]  resistant leukemic cells revealed VDAC1 , SNX3 , and PFDN6 are promising proteins that might serve as

 Beneficial effects of **voglibose administration** [T121]  on body weight and lipid metabolism via gastrointestinal bile acid modification This study was designed with the goal of examining the effects of **voglibose administration** [T121]  on body weight and lipid metabolism and underlying mechanism **high fat diet** [T061]  -induced **obese** [T047] ()  mice . Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to one of four groups : a **control diet** [T061]  ( CTL ) , **high - fat diet** [T061]  ( HF ) , **high - fat diet** [T061]  supplemented with **voglibose** [T121]  ( **VO** [T121]  ) , and **high fat diet** [T061]  pair - fed group ( PF ) . After 12 weeks , the following characteristics were investigated : **serum lipid and** [T059]  **glucose levels** [T059]  , serum **glucose levels polar metabolite profiles** [T059]  , and expression levels of genes involved in lipid and bile acid metabolism . In addition , **pyrosequencing** [T059]  was used to analyze the composition of **gut microbiota** [T001]  found in feces . **Total body weight gain was significantly lower** [T033]  in the VO group than in the CTL , HF , and PF groups . The VO group exhibited improved metabolic profiles including those of blood glucose , triglyceride , and **total cholesterol levels** [T059]  . The 12- week **voglibose administration** [T121]  decreased the ratio of **Firmicutes** [T007]  to **Bacteroidetes** [T007]  found in feces . Circulating levels of **taurocholic** [T184] ()  and **cholic acid** [T121]  were significantly higher in the VO group than in the HF and CTL groups . **Deoxycholic acid** [T121]  levels tended to be higher in the VO group than in the HF group . **Voglibose administration** [T121]  downregulated expression levels of CYP8B1 and HNF4α genes and upregulated those of PGC1α , whereas FXRα was not affected . **Voglibose administration** [T121]  elicits changes in the composition of the **intestinal** [T023]  **microbiota** [T001]  and circulating metabolites , which ultimately has systemic effects on body weight and lipid metabolism in mice .

 Smooth versus Textured Surfaces : Feature -Based Category Selectivity in Human Visual Cortex In **fMRI** [T060]  studies , human lateral **fMRI occipital** [T060]  ( LO ) cortex is thought to respond selectively to images of objects , compared with nonobjects . However , it remains unresolved whether all objects evoke equivalent levels of activity in LO , and , if not , which image features produce stronger activation . Here , we used an unbiased parametric texture model to predict preferred versus nonpreferred stimuli in LO . Observation and psychophysical results showed that predicted preferred stimuli ( both objects and nonobjects ) had smooth ( rather than textured ) surfaces . These predictions were confirmed using **fMRI** [T060]  , for objects and nonobjects . Similar preferences were also found in the **fusiform face area** [T023]  ( FFA ) . Consistent with this : ( 1 ) FFA and LO responded more strongly to nonfreckled ( smooth ) faces , compared with otherwise identical freckled ( textured ) faces ; and ( 2 ) strong functional connections were found between LO and FFA . Thus , LO and FFA may be part of an information - processing stream distinguished by feature -based category selectivity ( smooth > textured ) .

 In situ **stabilization** [T061]  of heavy metals in multiple- metal contaminated paddy soil using different steel slag -based silicon fertilizer Steel slag has been widely used as amendment and silicon fertilizer to alleviate the mobility and bioavailability of heavy metals in soil . The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of particle size , composition , and application rate of slag on metal immobilization in acidic soil , metals uptake by rice and rice growth . The results indicated that application of slag increased soil pH , plant -available silicon concentrations in soil , and decreased the bioavailability of metals compared with control treatment , whereas pulverous slag ( S1 ) was more effective than granular slag ( S2 and S3 ) . The acid - extractable fraction of Cd in the spiked soil was significantly decreased with application of S1 at rates of 1 and 3 % , acid - extractable fractions of **Cu** [T121]  and **Zn** [T121]  were decreased when treated at 3 % . Use of S1 at both rates resulted in significantly lower Cd , **Cu** [T121]  , and **Zn** [T121]  concentrations in rice tissues than in controls by 82.6 - 92.9 , 88.4 - 95.6 , and 67.4 - 81.4 % , respectively . However , use of pulverous slag at 1 % significantly promotes rice growth , restricted rice growth when treated at 3 % . Thus , the results explained that reduced particle size and suitable application rate of slag could be beneficial to rice growth and metals **stabilization** [T061]  .

 Genetic Diversity in Various Accessions of Pineapple [ Ananas comosus ( L. ) Merr . ] Using ISSR and SSR Markers Inter simple sequence repeat ( ISSR ) and simple sequence repeat ( SSR ) markers were used to assess the genetic diversity of 36 pineapple accessions that were introduced from 10 countries / regions . Thirteen ISSR primers amplified 96 bands , of which 91 ( 93.65 % ) were polymorphic , whereas 20 SSR primers amplified 73 bands , of which 70 ( 96.50 % ) were polymorphic . Nei 's gene diversity ( h = 0.28 ) , Shannon 's information index ( I = 0.43 ) , and polymorphism information content ( PIC = 0.29 ) generated using the SSR primers were higher than that with ISSR primers ( h = 0.23 , I = 0.37 , PIC = 0.24 ) , thereby suggesting that the SSR system is more efficient than the ISSR system in assessing genetic diversity in various pineapple accessions . Mean genetic similarities were 0.74 , 0.61 , and 0.69 , as determined using ISSR , SSR , and combined ISSR / SSR , respectively . These results suggest that the genetic diversity among pineapple accessions is very high . We clustered the 36 pineapple accessions into three or five groups on the basis of the phylogenetic trees constructed based on the results of ISSR , SSR , and combined ISSR / SSR analyses using the unweighted pair - group with arithmetic averaging ( UPGMA ) method . The results of principal components analysis ( PCA ) also supported the UPGMA clustering . These results will be useful not only for the scientific conservation and management of pineapple germplasm but also for the improvement of the current pineapple breeding strategies .

 An **evaluation** [T058]  of neuroendocrine dysfunction following **acute** [T047] ()  **aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage** [T047] ()  : A prospective study The aim was to investigate the incidence and pattern of neuroendocrine changes in cases of **acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage** [T047] ()  ( **SAH** [T047] ()  ) . **Endocrine assessment** [T060]  was performed in 100 consecutive cases of **acute aneurysmal SAH** [T047] ()  presenting within 7 days of **ictus** [T184][WikidataSympton] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ictal)  . The gonadotropic , somatotrophic , thyrotropic , and corticotrophic axes were **evaluated** [T058]  for their possible dysfunction . A total of 100 cases ( 38 males , 62 females ; age range - 17 - 76 years ; mean age - 43.6 years ) of **acute** [T047] ()  **SAH** [T047] ()  were studied . The **aneurysms** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm)  were located in the **anterior circulation** [T023]  ( n = 95 ) and **posterior circulation** [T023]  ( n = 5 ) . The most common

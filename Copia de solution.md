**Generalized Epilepsy ** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_epilepsy)and **Myoclonic Seizures ** [T184] in **22q11.2 ** [T047] ()**Deletion Syndrome ** [T047] ()Prompted by the observations of **juvenile myoclonic epilepsy ** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_myoclonic_epilepsy,  ,  ,  ,  )( **JME ** [T047] ()) in **22q11.2 ** [T047] ()**deletion syndrome ** [T047] ()( **22q11DS ** [T047] ()) and recurrent copy number variants in **Generalized Epilepsy ** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_epilepsy) and **Myoclonic Seizures ** [T184] in **22q11.2 ** [T047] () **Deletion Syndrome ** [T047] () Prompted by the observations of **juvenile myoclonic epilepsy ** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_myoclonic_epilepsy) ( **JME ** [T047] () ) in **22q11.2 ** [T047] () **deletion syndrome ** [T047] () ( **22q11DS ** [T047] () ) and recurrent copy number variants in **genetic generalized epilepsy ** [T047] () ( **GGE ** [T047] () ) , we searched for further evidence supporting a possible correlation of **22q11DS ** [T047] () with **GGE ** [T047] () and with **myoclonic seizures ** [T184] . Through routine **diagnostics ** [T060] , we identified 3 novel individuals with the seemingly uncommon combination of **22q11DS ** [T047] () and **JME ** [T047] () . We subsequently screened the literature for reports focussing on the **epilepsy ** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy) phenotype in **22q11DS ** [T047] () . We additionally screened a database of 173 **22q11DS ** [T047] () patients and identified a fourth individual with **JME ** [T047] () as well as 2 additional cases with **GGE ** [T047] () . We describe 6 novel and 22 published cases with co - occurrence of **22q11DS ** [T047] () and **GGE ** [T047] () . In many patients , **GGE ** [T047] () was associated with **myoclonic seizures ** [T184] allowing for a **diagnosis ** [T033] of **JME ** [T047] () in at least 6 individuals . Seventeen of the 173 **22q11DS ** [T047] () cases ( 10 % ) had a **diagnosis ** [T033] of either **focal ** [T047] () or **generalized epilepsy ** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_epilepsy) . In these cases , **focal epilepsy ** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_seizure) could often be attributed to **syndrome - associated ** [T047] () **hypocalcaemia ** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocalcemia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocalcemia) , **cerebral bleeds ** [T047] () , or **structural brain anomalies ** [T019] . However , the cause of **GGE ** [T047] () remained **unclear ** [T033] . In this study , we describe and review 28 individuals with **22q11DS ** [T047] () and **GGE ** [T047] () ( especially **JME ** [T047] () ) , showing that both **disorders ** [T047] () frequently co - occur . Compared to the reported prevalence of 15 - 21 % , in our case series only 10 % of **22q11DS ** [T047] () individuals were found to have **epilepsy ** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy) , often **GGE ** [T047] () . Since 22q11.2 does not contain convincing **GGE ** [T047] () candidate genes , we discuss the possibility of an aetiological correlation through a possibly disturbed interaction with the GABAB receptor . 

The Histone Acetyltransferase Gcn5 Positively Regulates T Cell Activation Histone acetyltransferases ( HATs ) regulate inducible transcription in multiple cellular processes and during inflammatory and immune response . However , the functions of general control nonrepressed - protein 5 ( Gcn5 ) , an evolutionarily conserved HAT from yeast to human , in immune regulation remain unappreciated . In this study , we conditionally deleted Gcn5 ( encoded by the Kat2a gene ) specifically in T lymphocytes by crossing floxed Gcn5 and Lck - Cre mice , and demonstrated that Gcn5 plays important roles in multiple stages of T cell functions including development , clonal expansion , and differentiation . Loss of Gcn5 functions impaired T cell proliferation , IL-2 production , and Th1 / Th17 , but not Th2 and regulatory T cell differentiation . Gcn5 is recruited onto the il-2 promoter by interacting with the NFAT in T cells upon TCR stimulation . Interestingly , instead of directly acetylating NFAT , Gcn5 catalyzes histone H3 lysine H9 acetylation to promote IL-2 production . T cell -specific suppression of Gcn5 partially protected mice from myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein - induced **experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ** [T050] , an experimental model for human **multiple sclerosis ** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis) . Our study reveals previously unknown physiological functions for Gcn5 and a molecular mechanism underlying these functions in regulating T cell immunity . Hence Gcn5 may be an important new target for **autoimmune disease therapy ** [T047] () . 

Effects of **soybean isoflavone ** [T121] on **intestinal ** [T023] antioxidant capacity and cytokines in young piglets fed oxidized fish oil To investigate the effect of glycitein , a synthetic **soybean isoflavone ** [T121] ( **ISF ** [T121] ) , on the **intestinal ** [T023] antioxidant capacity , morphology , and cytokine content in young piglets fed oxidized fish oil , 72 4 - d - old male piglets were assigned to three treatments . The control group was fed a basal diet containing fresh fish oil , and the other two groups received the same diet except for the **substitution ** [T061] with the same dosage of oxidized fish oil alone or with **ISF ** [T121] ( oxidized fish oil plus **ISF ** [T121] ) . After 21 d of feeding , **supplementation ** [T061] of oxidized fish oil increased the levels of malondialdehyde ( MDA ) , oxidized glutathione ( GSSG ) , interleukin-1β ( IL-1β ) , tumor necrosis factor - α ( TNF - α ) , interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) , nuclear factor κ B ( NF - κB ) , inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) , **NO ** [T121] , and Caspase-3 in jejunal mucosa , and decreased the villous height in **duodenum ** [T023] and the levels of secretory immunoglobulin A ( sIgA ) and IL-4 in the jejunal mucosa compared with supplementation with fresh oil . The addition of oxidized fish oil plus **ISF ** [T121] partially alleviated this **negative ** [T033] effect . The addition of oxidized **negative fish oil ** [T033] plus **ISF ** [T121] increased the villous height and levels of sIgA and IL-4 in jejunal mucosa , but decreased the levels of IL-1β and IL-2 in jejunal mucosa ( P<0.05 ) compared with oxidized fish oil . Collectively , these results show that dietary supplementation of **ISF ** [T121] could partly alleviate the **negative ** [T033] effect of oxidized fish oil by improving the **intestinal ** [T023] morphology as well as the antioxidant capacity and immune function in young piglets . 

**Preclinical fibrinolysis ** [T061] in patients with **ST - segment elevation myocardial infarction ** [T047] () in a rural region In the current guidelines for the **treatment ** [T061] of patients with **ST - segment elevation myocardial infarction ** [T047] () ( **STEMI ** [T047] () ) , the European Society of Cardiology ( ESC ) recommends preclinical **STEMI fibrinolysis ** [T047] () as a **reperfusion therapy ** [T061] if , due to long transportation times , no **cardiac catheterisation ** [T058] is available within 90 - 120 min . However , there is little remaining in - depth expertise in this method because **fibrinolysis ** [T060] is presently only **fibrinolysis rarely indicated ** [T060] . In a rural area in southwestern Germany , where an emergency **primary percutaneous coronary intervention ** [T061] was not routinely available within 90 - 120 min , 156 **STEMI ** [T047] () patients underwent **fibrinolysis ** [T060] with the **plasminogen activator reteplase ** [T121] , performed by trained emergency physicians . The practicality of the **treatment ** [T061] , as well as complications and the mortality of the patients in the preclinical phase until arrival at the hospital , were retrospectively studied . The mean time from onset of the **symptoms ** [T184] to first medical contact was 114 ± 116 min . The mean interval to the start of **fibrinolysis ** [T061] of 13.5 ± 6.4 min was within the 30 min mandated by the ESC . Patients with **inferior STEMI ** [T047] () represented the largest subgroup . Occurring in 39 cases ( 25 % ) , complications due to **infarction ** [T047] () were relatively common during the prehospital phase , including 15 cases ( 9.6 % ) of cardiogenic shock , but in all cases the complications were manageable . No patient died before arrival at the hospital . As **lysis ** [T061] - associated adverse effects , merely two uncomplicated mucosal haemorrhages and one case of mild **allergic ** [T184] skin reactions were seen . In emergency situations with long transportation times to the nearest suitable cardiac catheterisation laboratory , **preclinical fibrinolysis ** [T061] in **STEMI ** [T047] () still represents a workable method . Success of this strategy requires particularly strong training of the emergency physicians in **ECG ** [T033] and **lysis therapy ** [T061] , and co - operation with nearby cardiac centres . 

How should proxies of cognitive reserve be **evaluated ** [T058] in a population of healthy older adults ? While some tools have been developed to estimate an individual 's cognitive reserve ( CR ) , no study has assessed the adequacy of the method used for **assessing ** [T058] these CR proxy indicators . Therefore , we aimed to determine the most appropriate method to estimate CR by comparing two approaches : ( 1 ) the common **assessment ** [T058] of CR proxies in the literature ( e.g. years of education ) and ( 2 ) the calculation of a comprehensive index based on most significant **parameters ** [T033] used in the estimation of CR . Data on CR proxies ( i.e. education , occupation , and leisure activities ) were obtained in a sample of 204 older adults . Regression analyses were used to develop the two indices of CR ( i.e. ICR - standard and ICR - detailed ) and to determine which index best represented the level of one 's CR . The ICR - standard was calculated using a combination of the three most common measures of reserve in the literature : number of schooling years , complexity of the primary occupation , and amount of current participation in stimulating activities . The ICR - detailed was calculated using the most significant parameters ( established in initial analyses ) of CR : highest level of education combined with the number of training courses , last occupation , and amount of current participation in social and intellectual activities . The comparison of both indices showed that higher levels of ICR - standard and ICR - detailed were associated with a greater minimization of the effects of age on cognition . However , the ICR - detailed was more strongly associated to this minimization than the ICR - standard , suggesting that the ICR - detailed best reflect one 's CR . This study is the first to show that it is of great importance to question methods measuring CR proxies in order to develop a clinical tool allowing a comprehensive and accurate estimation of CR . 

Identification of potential predictive markers of **dexamethasone ** [T121] resistance in childhood **acute lymphoblastic leukemia ** [T191] Response to **dexamethasone ** [T121] ( **DEXA ** [T121] ) , as a hallmark **drug ** [T121] in the **treatment ** [T061] of childhood **acute lymphoblastic leukemia ** [T191] ( **ALL ** [T191] ) , is one of the pivotal prognostic factors in the prediction of outcome in **ALL ** [T191] . Identification of predictive markers of chemoresistance is beneficial to selecting of the best **therapeutic protocol ** [T061] with the lowest effect adverse . Hence , we aimed to find drug targets using the **2DE / MS proteomics ** [T059] study of a **DEXA ** [T121] - resistant cell line ( REH ) as a model for poor **DEXA ** [T121] responding patients before and after **drug treatment ** [T061] . Using the **proteomic methods ** [T059] , three differentially expressed proteins were detected , including voltage dependent anion channel 1 ( VDAC1 ) , sorting Nexin 3 ( SNX3 ) , and prefoldin subunit 6 ( PFDN6 ) . We observed low expression of three proteins after **DEXA ** [T121] treatment in REH cells . We subsequently verified low expression of resulted proteins at the mRNA level using the **quantitative PCR method ** [T059] . These proteins are promising proteins because of their important roles in drug resistance and regulation of apoptosis ( VDAC1 ) , protein trafficking ( SNX3 ) , and protein folding ( PFDN6 ) . Additionally , mRNA expression level of these proteins was assessed in 17 bone marrow samples from children with newly diagnosed **ALL ** [T191] and 7 non - cancerous samples as controls . The results indicated that independent of the molecular subtypes of **leukemia ** [T191] , mRNA expression of VDAC1 , SNX3 , and PFDN6 decreased in **ALL ** [T191] samples compared with non - cancerous samples particularly in VDAC1 ( p < 0.001 ) . Additionally , mRNA expression of three proteins was also declined in **high - risk ** [T033] samples compared with **standard risk ** [T033] cases . These results demonstrated diagnostic and prognostic value of these proteins in **childhood ALL ** [T191] . Furthermore , investigation of protein - protein interaction using STRING database indicated that these proteins involved in the signaling pathway of NR3C1 as **dexamethasone ** [T121] target . In conclusion , our **proteomic study ** [T059] in **DEXA ** [T121] resistant leukemic cells revealed VDAC1 , SNX3 , and PFDN6 are promising proteins that might serve as 

Beneficial effects of **voglibose administration ** [T121] on body weight and lipid metabolism via gastrointestinal bile acid modification This study was designed with the goal of examining the effects of **voglibose administration ** [T121] on body weight and lipid metabolism and underlying mechanism **high fat diet ** [T061] -induced **obese ** [T047] () mice . Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to one of four groups : a **control diet ** [T061] ( CTL ) , **high - fat diet ** [T061] ( HF ) , **high - fat diet ** [T061] supplemented with **voglibose ** [T121] ( **VO ** [T121] ) , and **high fat diet ** [T061] pair - fed group ( PF ) . After 12 weeks , the following characteristics were investigated : **serum lipid and ** [T059] **glucose levels ** [T059] , serum **glucose levels polar metabolite profiles ** [T059] , and expression levels of genes involved in lipid and bile acid metabolism . In addition , **pyrosequencing ** [T059] was used to analyze the composition of **gut microbiota ** [T001] found in feces . **Total body weight gain was significantly lower ** [T033] in the VO group than in the CTL , HF , and PF groups . The VO group exhibited improved metabolic profiles including those of blood glucose , triglyceride , and **total cholesterol levels ** [T059] . The 12- week **voglibose administration ** [T121] decreased the ratio of **Firmicutes ** [T007] to **Bacteroidetes ** [T007] found in feces . Circulating levels of **taurocholic ** [T184] and **cholic acid ** [T121] were significantly higher in the VO group than in the HF and CTL groups . **Deoxycholic acid ** [T121] levels tended to be higher in the VO group than in the HF group . **Voglibose administration ** [T121] downregulated expression levels of CYP8B1 and HNF4α genes and upregulated those of PGC1α , whereas FXRα was not affected . **Voglibose administration ** [T121] elicits changes in the composition of the **intestinal ** [T023] **microbiota ** [T001] and circulating metabolites , which ultimately has systemic effects on body weight and lipid metabolism in mice . 

Smooth versus Textured Surfaces : Feature -Based Category Selectivity in Human Visual Cortex In **fMRI ** [T060] studies , human lateral **fMRI occipital ** [T060] ( LO ) cortex is thought to respond selectively to images of objects , compared with nonobjects . However , it remains unresolved whether all objects evoke equivalent levels of activity in LO , and , if not , which image features produce stronger activation . Here , we used an unbiased parametric texture model to predict preferred versus nonpreferred stimuli in LO . Observation and psychophysical results showed that predicted preferred stimuli ( both objects and nonobjects ) had smooth ( rather than textured ) surfaces . These predictions were confirmed using **fMRI ** [T060] , for objects and nonobjects . Similar preferences were also found in the **fusiform face area ** [T023] ( FFA ) . Consistent with this : ( 1 ) FFA and LO responded more strongly to nonfreckled ( smooth ) faces , compared with otherwise identical freckled ( textured ) faces ; and ( 2 ) strong functional connections were found between LO and FFA . Thus , LO and FFA may be part of an information - processing stream distinguished by feature -based category selectivity ( smooth > textured ) . 

In situ **stabilization ** [T061] of heavy metals in multiple- metal contaminated paddy soil using different steel slag -based silicon fertilizer Steel slag has been widely used as amendment and silicon fertilizer to alleviate the mobility and bioavailability of heavy metals in soil . The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of particle size , composition , and application rate of slag on metal immobilization in acidic soil , metals uptake by rice and rice growth . The results indicated that application of slag increased soil pH , plant -available silicon concentrations in soil , and decreased the bioavailability of metals compared with control treatment , whereas pulverous slag ( S1 ) was more effective than granular slag ( S2 and S3 ) . The acid - extractable fraction of Cd in the spiked soil was significantly decreased with application of S1 at rates of 1 and 3 % , acid - extractable fractions of **Cu ** [T121] and **Zn ** [T121] were decreased when treated at 3 % . Use of S1 at both rates resulted in significantly lower Cd , **Cu ** [T121] , and **Zn ** [T121] concentrations in rice tissues than in controls by 82.6 - 92.9 , 88.4 - 95.6 , and 67.4 - 81.4 % , respectively . However , use of pulverous slag at 1 % significantly promotes rice growth , restricted rice growth when treated at 3 % . Thus , the results explained that reduced particle size and suitable application rate of slag could be beneficial to rice growth and metals **stabilization ** [T061] . 

Genetic Diversity in Various Accessions of Pineapple [ Ananas comosus ( L. ) Merr . ] Using ISSR and SSR Markers Inter simple sequence repeat ( ISSR ) and simple sequence repeat ( SSR ) markers were used to assess the genetic diversity of 36 pineapple accessions that were introduced from 10 countries / regions . Thirteen ISSR primers amplified 96 bands , of which 91 ( 93.65 % ) were polymorphic , whereas 20 SSR primers amplified 73 bands , of which 70 ( 96.50 % ) were polymorphic . Nei 's gene diversity ( h = 0.28 ) , Shannon 's information index ( I = 0.43 ) , and polymorphism information content ( PIC = 0.29 ) generated using the SSR primers were higher than that with ISSR primers ( h = 0.23 , I = 0.37 , PIC = 0.24 ) , thereby suggesting that the SSR system is more efficient than the ISSR system in assessing genetic diversity in various pineapple accessions . Mean genetic similarities were 0.74 , 0.61 , and 0.69 , as determined using ISSR , SSR , and combined ISSR / SSR , respectively . These results suggest that the genetic diversity among pineapple accessions is very high . We clustered the 36 pineapple accessions into three or five groups on the basis of the phylogenetic trees constructed based on the results of ISSR , SSR , and combined ISSR / SSR analyses using the unweighted pair - group with arithmetic averaging ( UPGMA ) method . The results of principal components analysis ( PCA ) also supported the UPGMA clustering . These results will be useful not only for the scientific conservation and management of pineapple germplasm but also for the improvement of the current pineapple breeding strategies . 

An **evaluation ** [T058] of neuroendocrine dysfunction following **acute ** [T047] () **aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ** [T047] () : A prospective study The aim was to investigate the incidence and pattern of neuroendocrine changes in cases of **acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ** [T047] () ( **SAH ** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ufufunyane) ) . **Endocrine assessment ** [T060] was performed in 100 consecutive cases of **acute aneurysmal SAH ** [T047] () presenting within 7 days of **ictus ** [T184] . The gonadotropic , somatotrophic , thyrotropic , and corticotrophic axes were **evaluated ** [T058] for their possible dysfunction . A total of 100 cases ( 38 males , 62 females ; age range - 17 - 76 years ; mean age - 43.6 years ) of **acute ** [T047] () **SAH ** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ufufunyane) were studied . The **aneurysms ** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm) were located in the **anterior circulation ** [T023] ( n = 95 ) and **posterior circulation ** [T023] ( n = 5 ) . The most common **hormone deficiency ** [T047] () was of **growth hormone ** [T121] ( n = 67 ) , followed by **gonadotrophin ** [T121] ( n = 50 ) , **corticotrophin ** [T121] ( n = 49 ) and thyrotrophin ( n = 35 ) . **Hyperprolactinemia ** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperprolactinaemia) was noted in 10 cases . One - pituitary hormone axis deficiency was noted in 26 cases while 67 cases had two or more pituitary hormone axes dysfunction . A total of 93 cases had hormonal dysfunction in one or more pituitary hormone axes , and seven cases had **no ** [T033] **hormonal dysfunction ** [T047] () . Endocrine dysfunction occurs in 93 % cases of **acute ** [T047] () **SAH ** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ufufunyane) and multiple pituitary hormone axes dysfunction occurs in 67 % cases . It is suggested that **hormonal evaluation ** [T060] should be considered as part of **management ** [T058] of acute **SAH ** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ufufunyane) . 

**Determining ** [T058] putative vectors of the **Bogia Coconut Syndrome ** [T047] () **phytoplasma ** [T007] using **loop - mediated isothermal amplification ** [T059] of single - insect feeding media **Phytoplasmas ** [T007] are insect vectored mollicutes responsible for **disease ** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_X, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease) in many economically important crops . Determining which insect species are vectors of a given **phytoplasma ** [T007] is important for managing **disease ** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_X, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease) but is methodologically challenging because disease - free plants need to be exposed to large numbers of insects , often over many months . A relatively new method to **detect ** [T033] likely transmission involves **molecular testing ** [T059] for phytoplasma DNA in sucrose solution that insects have fed upon . In this study we combined this feeding medium method with a **loop - mediated isothermal amplification ** [T059] ( **LAMP ** [T059] ) **LAMP assay ** [T059] to study 627 insect specimens of 11 Hemiptera taxa sampled from sites in Papua New Guinea affected by **Bogia coconut syndrome ** [T047] () ( **BCS ** [T047] () ) . The **LAMP assay ** [T059] **detected ** [T033] phytoplasma DNA from the feeding solution and head tissue of insects from six taxa belonging to four families : Derbidae , Lophopidae , Flatidae and Ricaniidae . Two other taxa yielded positives only from the heads and the remainder tested **negative ** [T033] . These results demonstrate the utility of combining single - insect feeding medium tests with **LAMP assays ** [T059] to identify putative vectors that can be the subject of transmission **LAMP assays tests ** [T059] and to better understand **phytoplasma ** [T007] pathosystems . 

A Case Presenting with **Splenic Infarct ** [T047] () Diagnosed as Primary Bone Marrow CD5 Positive **DLBCL ** [T191] : A Clinicopathological Correlation De novo CD5 + **Diffuse large B cell lymphoma ** [T191] ( **DLBCL ** [T191] ) is a rare and aggressive subtype of **DLBCL ** [T191] . It is a distinct clinicopathologic entity with complex molecular profile and **poor prognosis ** [T033] . A 59 year old female presented with **pyrexia of unknown origin ** [T184] since 1 month . On examination , there was severe **pyrexia of unknown origin pallor ** [T184] , **hepatosplenomegaly ** [T184] and **no palpable lymphadenopathy ** [T033] . **Complete blood count ** [T059] revealed bicytopenia with normal **total leucocyte count ** [T059] . Liver and renal **total leucocyte count function tests ** [T059] were normal . **Ultrasonography ** [T060] abdomen revealed **splenic enlargement ** [T033] with two focal **splenic enlargement lesions ** [T033] attributed to either **splenic abscess ** [T047] () or infarcts . Patient was being managed as **splenic infarct ** [T047] () but continued to have **bicytopenia ** [T047] () . Further investigation showed elevated **bicytopenia serum ferritin ** [T047] () , triglycerides and LDH . With a clinical suspicion of **infection ** [T047] () and **haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis ** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemophagocytic_lymphohistiocytosis) **bone marrow aspiration ** [T060] **bone marrow aspiration ** [T060] ( **BMA ** [T060] ) and **biopsy ** [T060] ( **BMBx ** [T060] ) **BMA biopsy ** [T060] was done . **BMA ** [T060] showed extensive haemophagocytosis and ~7.4 % large lymphoma - like cells . On this basis **PET - CT ** [T060] was suggested which showed **enlarged spleen ** [T033] with diffuse uptake . **BMBx ** [T060] showed nodular and intrasinusoidal collection of abnormal lymphoid cells . On **immunohistochemistry ** [T059] , these cells were positive for CD20 , CD5 , MUM1 , BCL-2 , BCL-6 and negative for CD3 , CD10 and CD23 . CD34 highlighted focal intrasinusoidal pattern . The complete clinicopathological profile suggested the **diagnosis ** [T033] of de novo CD5 + **DLBCL ** [T191] , with primary hepatosplenic pattern of involvement . CD5 + **DLBCL ** [T191] presenting as **splenic infarct ** [T047] () is very rare . This case was unusual as the **diagnosis ** [T033] of a **primary aggressive lymphoma ** [T191] with haemophagocytosis was established in a patient who presented with **fever ** [T184] and **splenic infarct ** [T047] () without **lymphadenopathy ** [T184] . This indicates the importance of good morphological assessment of a 

**Opioid ** [T121] Use in **Chronic Pain ** [T184] Patients with **Chronic Kidney Disease ** [T047] () : A Systematic Review To investigate the prevalence of **chronic pain ** [T184] and **opioid management ** [T121] among patients with **chronic kidney disease ** [T047] () ( **CKD ** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_keratin_disorder, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complicated_grief_disorder) ) . Systematic review . A systematic search was performed , including citations from 1960 to May 2015 . The review highlights methodological quality assessment of the selected studies ; prevalence of **pain ** [T184] ; type , dose , and reason for **opioid ** [T121] use ; effectiveness of **pain control ** [T061] and associated adverse effects of **opioids ** [T121] in **CKD ** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_keratin_disorder, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complicated_grief_disorder) patients . Twelve of 131 articles met inclusion criteria . There were no randomized controlled trials ( RCT ) evaluable , and 12 were observational studies . Out of 12 studies , four were of high quality , six were of moderate quality , and the remaining two were low - quality studies . The studies were from different countries with sample size ranging from 10 to 12,782 . Several studies showed a high prevalence of **chronic uncontrolled pain ** [T184] . The effectiveness of different categories of **opioids ** [T121] , dose , duration , and commonly **prescribed ** [T058] **opioids ** [T121] varied across studies . Based on a systematic review of the current literature , there is fair evidence for the high prevalence of **chronic pain ** [T184] among patients with **CKD ** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_keratin_disorder, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complicated_grief_disorder) , which is not being effectively managed , probably due to underprescription of **analgesics ** [T121] or **opioids ** [T121] in the **CKD ** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_keratin_disorder, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complicated_grief_disorder) population . Clinicians are in need of additional and well - designed randomized control trials that focus on the indications for **opioid ** [T121] **therapy ** [T061] , appropriate **opioid ** [T121] doses and dosing intervals , outcomes with adequacy of **symptom control ** [T058] , and reporting on the incidence of adverse side effects . 

Genome - Wide SNP Linkage Mapping and QTL Analysis for Fiber Quality and Yield Traits in the Upland Cotton Recombinant Inbred Lines Population It is of significance to discover genes related to fiber quality and yield traits and tightly linked markers for marker - assisted selection ( MAS ) in cotton breeding . In this study , 188 F8 recombinant inbred lines ( RILs ) , derived from a intraspecific cross between HS46 and MARCABUCAG8US-1 - 88 were genotyped by the cotton 63 **symptom control K single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) assay ** [T058] . Field trials were conducted in Sanya , Hainan Province , during the 2014 - 2015 cropping seasons under standard conditions . Results revealed significant differences ( P < 0.05 ) among RILs , environments and replications for fiber quality and yield traits . Broad - sense heritabilities of all traits including fiber length , fiber uniformity , micronaire , fiber elongation , fiber strength , boll weight , and lint percentage ranged from 0.26 to 0.66 . A 1784.28 cM ( centimorgans ) linkage map , harboring 2618 polymorphic SNP markers , was constructed , which had 0.68 cM per marker density . Seventy - one quantitative trait locus ( QTLs ) for fiber quality and yield traits were detected on 21 chromosomes , explaining 4.70~32.28 % phenotypic variance , in which 16 were identified as stable QTLs across two environments . Meanwhile , 12 certain regions were investigated to be involved in the control of one ( hotspot ) or more ( cluster ) traits , mainly focused on Chr05 , Chr09 , Chr10 , Chr14 , Chr19 , and Chr20 . Nineteen pairs of epistatic QTLs ( e - QTLs ) were identified , of which two pairs involved in two additive QTLs . These additive QTLs , e - QTLs , and QTL clusters were tightly linked to SNP markers , which may serve as target regions for map - based cloning , gene discovery , and MAS in cotton breeding . 

Safety and immunogenecity of a **live attenuated Rift Valley fever vaccine ** [T121] ( **CL13 T ** [T121] ) in camels **Rift Valley fever ** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rift_Valley_fever) is an emerging **zoonotic viral disease ** [T047] () , enzootic and endemic in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula , which poses a significant threat to both human and animal health . The **disease ** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_X, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease) is most severe in ruminants causing **abortions ** [T033] in pregnant animals , especially sheep animals and high mortality in young populations . High mortality rates and severe **abortions clinical manifestation ** [T033] have also been reported among camel populations in Africa , to attend however none of the currently available **live vaccines ** [T121] against **RVF ** [T005] have been tested for safety and efficacy in this species . In this study , the safety and efficacy ( through a neutralizing antibody response ) of the thermostable **RVF live attenuated RVF CL13 T vaccine ** [T005] were **evaluated ** [T058] in camels in two different preliminary experiments involving 16 camels , ( that 12 camels and 4 pregnant camels ) . The study revealed that the **CL13 T vaccine ** [T121] was safe to use in camels and no **abortions ** [T033] or teratogenic effects were observed . The single dose of the **vaccine ** [T121] stimulated a strong and long - lasting neutralizing antibody response for up to 12 months . The presence of neutralization antibodies is likely to correlate with protection ; however protection would need to be confirmed by challenge experiments using the **virulent ** [T001] **RVF virus ** [T005] . 

Adverse events risk associated with **angiogenesis inhibitors ** [T121] addition to **therapy ** [T061] in **ovarian cancer ** [T191] : a meta - analysis of randomized controlled trials **Inhibition of angiogenesis ** [T121] has been regarded as an attractive **treatment strategy ** [T061] for advanced or recurrent **ovarian cancer ** [T191] . We conduct this meta - analysis to investigate the risk of adverse events of special interest related to **angiogenesis inhibitors ** [T121] ( **AIs ** [T121] ) in **ovarian cancer ** [T191] . Databases from PubMed , Web of Science and Cochrane library up to December 2015 were searched to identify relevant studies . Eligible studies included prospective randomized controlled phase II / III clinical trials evaluating **therapy ** [T061] with or without **AIs ** [T121] for **ovarian cancer ** [T191] . Summary relative risk ( RR ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) were calculated using random - effects or fixed - effects according to the heterogeneity among included trials . A total of 7,761 patients from ten clinical trials were included in the meta - analysis . Pooled RR showed that the use of **AIs ** [T121] was associated with a statistically increased risk in four of the adverse outcomes studied : **arterial thromboembolic ** [T047] () events ( RR = 2.0 ) , **gastrointestinal ( GI ) perforation ** [T047] () ( RR = 3.86 ) , **proteinuria ** [T184] ( RR = 2.44 ) , and **hypertension ** [T047] () ( RR = 5.39 ) . No statistically significant differences were found for hemorrhagic events ( p = 0.07 ) , venous thromboembolic events ( p = 0.13 ) , or fatal adverse events ( p = 0.26 ) . The addition of **AIs ** [T121] to **therapy ** [T061] in **ovarian cancer ** [T191] did significantly increase the risk of **arterial thromboembolic ** [T047] () events , **GI perforation ** [T047] () , **proteinuria ** [T184] and **hypertension ** [T047] () , but not for **venous thromboembolic events ** [T047] () , hemorrhagic events , or fatal adverse events . 

The **Aortic Root ** [T023] : Natural History After **Root - Sparing Ascending Replacement ** [T061] in **Nonsyndromic Aneurysmal ** [T047] () Patients Leaving native aortic tissue in situ in **root - sparing ascending aortic replacement ** [T061] raises concern regarding potential later need for root **root - sparing ascending aortic replacement reoperation ** [T061] or for the potential occurrence of localized dissections or rupture in the residual **root ** [T023] . The purpose of this study was to **evaluate ** [T058] the natural growth of the **aortic root ** [T023] after **root - sparing aortic replacement ** [T061] . In all , 102 consecutive patients ( mean age 61.8 ± 12.5 years ; 60 % male ) who had undergone **root - sparing aortic replacement ** [T061] had sufficient retrievable information regarding their **aortic root ** [T023] diameter at postoperative baseline and follow **aortic root - up ** [T023] **imaging ** [T060] by **computed tomography ** [T060] or **echocardiography ** [T060] . The annual growth rate was **evaluated ** [T058] and also compared according to the influence of **valve ** [T023] morphology and concomitant **aortic valve replacement ** [T061] . Furthermore , the years of natural history that would require for **root ** [T023] **enlargement ** [T061] to meet a 50 mm threshold of the root diameter were calculated . The estimated growth rate of the **aortic root ** [T023] after **root - sparing aortic replacement ** [T061] is between 0.27 and 0.51 mm per year ( mean 0.41 mm , varying according to the underlying diameter ) and therefore fivefold less than other **aortic regions ** [T023] . Accordingly , a **root aneurysm ** [T047] () indicating **reoperation ** [T061] would not be expected for 29.1 years on average . Only patients with a diameter of 45 mm or more are at risk for **reoperation ** [T061] , and not until at least after 10.4 years have passed . Neither the valve morphology ( p = 0.62 ) nor concomitant **aortic valve replacement ** [T061] ( p = 0.86 ) influenced rate of root dilation . In **nonsyndromic ** [T033] patients , the **aortic root ** [T023] is the **slowest growing ** [T033] portion of the **thoracic aorta ** [T023] . Leaving the native **root ** [T023] , as in **root - sparing ascending aortic replacement ** [T061] , is a safe approach regarding secondary root **intervention ** [T061] for **aortic root ** [T023] diameters of 45 mm or less . 

Acute clinical adverse radiation effects after **Gamma Knife surgery ** [T061] for **vestibular schwannomas ** [T191] OBJECTIVE **Vestibular schwannomas ** [T191] ( **VSs ** [T191] ) represent a common indication of **Gamma Knife surgery ** [T061] ( **GKS ** [T061] ) . While most studies focus on the long - term morbidity and adverse radiation effects ( AREs ) , none describe the acute clinical AREs that might appear on a short - term basis . These types of events are investigated , and their incidence , type , and outcomes are reported in the present paper . METHODS The included patients were treated between July 2010 and March 2016 , underwent at least 6 months of **follow - up ** [T058] , and presented with a **disabling ** [T033] **symptom ** [T184] during the first 6 months after **GKS ** [T061] that affected their quality of life . The timing of appearance , as well as the type of main **symptom ** [T184] and **outcome ** [T033] , were noted . The prescribed dose was 12 Gy at the margin . RESULTS Thirty - five ( 22 % ) of 159 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria had acute clinical AREs . The mean followup period was 30 months ( range 6 - 49.2 months ) . The mean time of appearance was 37.9 days ( median 31 days ; range 3 - 110 days ) . In patients with de novo **symptoms ** [T184] , the more frequent **symptoms ** [T184] were **vertigo ** [T184] ( n = 4 ; 11.4 % ) and **gait disturbance ** [T184] ( n = 3 ; 8.6 % ) . The **exacerbation ** [T033] of a preexisting **symptom ** [T184] was more frequently related to **hearing loss ** [T033] ( n = 10 ; 28.6 % ) , followed by **gait disturbance ** [T184] ( n = 7 ; 20 % ) and **vertigo ** [T184] ( n = 3 , 8.6 % ) . In the univariate logistic regression analysis , the following factors were statistically significant : age ( p = 0.002 ; odds ratio [ OR ] 0.96 ) , hearing at baseline by Gardner - Robertson ( GR ) class ( p = 0.006 ; OR 0.21 ) , pure **vertigo tone average ** [T184] at baseline ( p = 0.006 ; OR 0.97 ) , and Koos grade at baseline ( with Koos Grade I used as a reference ) ( for Koos Grade II , OR 0.17 and p = 0.002 ; for Koos Grade III , OR 0.42 and p = 0.05 ) . The 

**Adenosine ** [T121] and the **adenosine A2A receptor ** [T121] **agonist ** [T121] , **CGS21680 ** [T121] , upregulate CD39 and CD73 expression through E2F-1 and CREB in regulatory T cells isolated from **septic ** [T047] () mice The number of regulatory T cells ( Treg cells ) and the expression of ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1 ( ENTPD1 ; also known as CD39 ) and 5'-ectonucleotidase ( NT5E ; also known as CD73 ) on the Treg cell surface are increased during **sepsis ** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis) . In this study , to determine the factors leading to the high expression of CD39 and CD73 , and the regulation of the CD39 / CD73 / adenosine pathway in Treg cells under **septic ** [T047] () conditions , we constructed a **mouse model ** [T050] of **sepsis ** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis) and separated the Treg cells using a flow cytometer . The Treg cells isolated from the peritoneal lavage and splenocytes of the mice were **treated with ** [T061] **adenosine ** [T121] or the specific **adenosine A2A receptor agonist ** [T121] , **CGS21680 ** [T121] , and were transfected with specific siRNA targeting E2F transcription factor 1 ( E2F-1 ) or cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) response element - binding protein ( CREB ) , which are predicted transcription regulatory factors of CD39 or CD73 . The regulatory relationships among these factors were then determined by **western blot analysis ** [T059] and dual - luciferase reporter **western blot analysis assay ** [T059] . In addition , changes in adenosine metabolism were measured in the treated cells . The results revealed that **adenosine ** [T121] and **CGS21680 ** [T121] significantly upregulated CD39 and CD73 expression ( P<0.01 ) . E2F-1 and CREB induced CD39 and CD73 expression , and were upregulated by **adenosine ** [T121] and **CGS21680 ** [T121] . **Adenosine triphosphate ** [T121] ( **ATP ** [T121] ) hydrolysis and adenosine generation were inhibited by the knockdown of E2F-1 or CREB , and were accelerated in the presence of **CGS21680 ** [T121] . Based on these results , it can be inferred that **adenosine ** [T121] , the **adenosine A2A receptor agonist ** [T121] , E2F-1 and CREB 

Variation in the age of first reproduction : different strategies or individual quality ? Although age at first reproduction is a key demographic parameter that is probably under high selective pressure , it is highly variable and the cause of this variability is not well understood . Two non - exclusive hypotheses may explain such variability . It could be the expression of different individual strategies , i.e. , different allocation strategies in fitness components , or the consequences of individual difference in intrinsic quality , i.e. , some individuals always doing better than others in all fitness components . We tested these hypotheses in the Wandering Albatross investigating relationships between the age at first reproduction and subsequent adult demographic traits . Using finite mixture capture recapture modeling , we demonstrate that the age at first reproduction is **negatively ** [T033] related to both reproductive performances and adult survival , suggesting that individual quality was an important factor explaining variation in the age at first reproduction . Our results suggest that age at first breeding is a good predictor of quality in this long - lived seabird species . 

Methodology development on aquatic environmental assessment The Water Framework Directive aims at reaching the good ecological status of the surface and ground water bodies ( László et al . Microchem J 85(1):65 - 71 , 2007 ) . The paper deals with quality evaluation of waters with special focus on the water chemistry parameters as defined in the Water Framework Directive and pertaining legal regulations . The purpose of this paper is to devise a quantitative type of water quality assessment method which could provide rapid , accurate , and reliable information on the quality of the surface waters by using water chemistry parameters . Quality classes have been defined for every water chemistry parameter in light of the legal limit values of the water parameters . In addition to this , weight indices were calculated on the basis of the outcome of the paired comparison of water chemistry parameters and normalized matrix . This was followed by the parametric level analysis of the water chemistry parameters , and finally , the aquatic environment index ( AEI ) was calculated , which provided general information on the quality of water regarding the water chemistry parameters . The method was illustrated on Lake Balaton , Hungary in which case water samples taken from Balatonfüred City lake area were analyzed and **evaluated ** [T058] with the method devised . 

Nutrients influence the thermal ecophysiology of an intertidal macroalga : multiple **evaluated stressors ** [T058] or multiple drivers ? Urbanization of coastlines is leading to increased introduction of nutrients from the terrestrial environment to nearshore habitats . While such nutrient influxes can be detrimental to coastal **marine ** [T001] **organisms ** [T001] due to increased eutrophication and subsequent **reduced oxygen ** [T121] , they could also have positive effects ( i.e. , increased food availability ) on species that are nitrogen - limited such as macroalgae . Nutrient enrichment in this environment thus has the potential to counteract some of the negative impacts of increasing temperatures , at least for some species . Characterizing the physiological response of **organisms ** [T001] to simultaneous changes in multiple drivers such as these is an important first step in predicting how global climate change may lead to ecological responses at more local levels . We evaluated how nutrient enrichment ( i.e. , nitrogen availability ) affected the growth of Fucus vesiculosus , a foundational macroalgal species in the North Atlantic rocky intertidal zone , and found that nutrient -enriched algal blades showed a significant increase in tissue growth compared to individuals grown under ambient conditions . We further quantified net photosynthesis by ambient and nutrient -enriched tissues at saturating irradiance over a range of temperature conditions ( 6 - 30 ° C ) . Respiration was unaffected by nutrient treatment ; however , there was a significant increase in photosynthetic oxygen production for nutrient -enriched tissue compared to ambient , but only at elevated ( ≥18 ° C ) temperatures . This study contributes to a growing body of literature showing the complexity of responses to changes in multiple drivers , and highlights the importance of studying the impacts of global climate change within the context of more local environmental conditions . 

Gga - miR-21 inhibits chicken pre - adipocyte proliferation in part by down - regulating Kruppel - like factor 5 Gga - miR-21 is abundantly expressed in chicken pre - adipocytes , but its role is unclear . The present study investigated the role of gga - miR-21 in chicken pre - adipocyte proliferation . **Cell proliferation assay ** [T059] and gene expression analysis of proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) showed that the gga - miR-21 mimic inhibited pre - adipocyte proliferation . In contrast , the gga - miR-21 **inhibitor ** [T121] enhanced pre - adipocyte proliferation . The subsequent investigation identified Kruppel - like factor 5 ( KLF5 ) mRNA as a target of gga - miR-21 . The gga - miR-21 mimic inhibited KLF5 3(')UTR reporter activity and decreased endogenous KLF5 expression in primary pre - adipocytes . KLF5 knockdown using RNAi had a similar effect to that of the gga - miR-21 mimic on cell proliferation . The promoting effect of the gga - miR-21 **inhibitor ** [T121] on pre - adipocyte proliferation was partially attenuated by KLF5 knockdown . Taken together , our results demonstrated that miR-21 inhibits chicken pre - adipocyte proliferation , at least in part , by targeting KLF5 . 

Distal **posterior cerebral artery ** [T023] **revascularization ** [T061] for a **fusiform PCA aneurysm ** [T047] () : A lesson learned The need for **revascularization ** [T061] with proximal **posterior cerebral artery occlusion ** [T047] () in the treatment of **giant ** [T047] () and **fusiform aneurysms ** [T047] () is **unclear ** [T033] . While early series demonstrated only about a 10 % chance of **infarction ** [T047] () following **posterior cerebral artery occlusion ** [T047] () , recently several authors have advocated a **bypass ** [T061] prior to **parent vessel ** [T023] **sacrifice ** [T061] in all cases . We present the case of an adult man with a **fusiform aneurysm ** [T047] () of the right **fusiform aneurysm posterior cerebral artery ** [T047] () at the P2 - P3 junction . He clinically failed a **balloon test occlusion ** [T060] preoperatively and therefore underwent an **occipital artery ** [T023] to distal **occipital artery posterior cerebral artery bypass ** [T023] with subsequent **endovascular occlusion ** [T061] of the **parent vessel ** [T023] and **aneurysm ** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm) . Despite the fact that the immediate and 6 month **follow up ** [T058] **cerebral angiography ** [T060] confirmed a patent **bypass ** [T023] , the patient still developed a **posterior cerebral artery territory stroke ** [T047] () . We believe this case demonstrates that successful distal **revascularization ** [T061] in the setting of proximal posterior **revascularization cerebral artery occlusion ** [T061] does not guarantee against **cerebral ischemia ** [T047] () and **infarction ** [T047] () even in those patients that fail a test **infarction occlusion ** [T047] () . 

Transcriptome sequencing and de novo characterization of Korean endemic land snail , Koreanohadra kurodana for functional transcripts and SSR markers The Korean endemic land snail Koreanohadra kurodana ( Gastropoda : Bradybaenidae ) found in humid areas of broadleaf forests and shrubs have been considered vulnerable as the number of individuals are declining in recent years . The species is poorly characterized at the genomic level that limits the understanding of functions at the molecular and genetics level . In the present study , we performed de novo transcriptome sequencing to produce a comprehensive transcript dataset of **visceral ** [T033] mass tissue of K. kurodana by the Illumina paired - end sequencing technology . Over 234 million quality reads were assembled to a total of 315,924 contigs and 191,071 unigenes , with an average and N50 length of 585.6 and 715 bp and 678 and 927 bp , respectively . Overall , 36.32 % of the unigenes found matches to known protein / nucleotide sequences in the public databases . The direction of the unigenes to functional categories was determined using COG , GO , KEGG , and InterProScan protein domain search . The GO analysis search resulted in 22,967 unigenes ( 12.02 % ) being categorized into 40 functional groups . The KEGG annotation revealed that metabolism pathway genes were enriched . The most prominent protein motifs include the zinc finger , ribonuclease H , reverse transcriptase , and ankyrin repeat domains . The simple sequence repeats ( SSRs ) identified from > 1 kb length of unigenes show a dominancy of dinucleotide repeat motifs followed with tri- and tetranucleotide motifs . A number of unigenes were putatively assessed to belong to adaptation and defense mechanisms including heat shock proteins 70 , Toll - like receptor 4 , AMP - activated protein kinase , aquaporin-2 , etc . Our data provide a rich source for the identification and functional characterization of new genes and candidate polymorphic SSR markers in K. kurodana . The availability of transcriptome information ( http://bioinfo.sch.ac.kr/submission/ ) would promote the utilization of the resources for phylogenetics study and genetic diversity assessment . 

The cancer Warburg effect may be a testable example of the minimum entropy production rate principle Cancer cells consume more **glucose ** [T121] by glycolytic fermentation to lactate than by respiration , a characteristic known as the Warburg effect . In contrast with the 34 moles of **ATP ** [T121] produced by respiration , fermentation produces two moles of **ATP ** [T121] per mole of **glucose ** [T121] consumed , which poses a puzzle on the function of the Warburg effect . Productions of free energy ( ΔG ) , enthalpy ( ΔH ) and entropy ( ΔS ) per mole linearly vary with the fraction ( x ) of **glucose ** [T121] consumed by fermentation that is frequently estimated around 0.9 . Hence , calculation shows that , in respect to pure respiration , the predominant fermentative metabolism decreases around 10 % the production of entropy per mole of **glucose ** [T121] consumed in cancer cells . We hypothesize that increased fermentation could allow cancer cells to accomplish the Prigogine theorem of the trend to minimize the rate of production of entropy . According the theorem , open cellular systems near the steady state could evolve to minimize the rates of entropy production that may be reached by modified replicating cells producing entropy at low rate . Remarkably , at **CO2 ** [T059] concentrations above 930 ppm , **glucose ** [T121] respiration produces less entropy than fermentation , which suggests experimental tests to validate the hypothesis of minimization of the rate of entropy production through the Warburg effect . 

Birth **glucose Preparedness ** [T121] and Complication Readiness Practice and Associated Factors among Pregnant Women , Northwest Ethiopia Background . Little is known about **birth preparedness ** [T033] and complication readiness ( BPCR ) plan in resource limited settings to decrease maternal mortality . Therefore , this study was done to **assess ** [T058] the status of BPCR and associated factors among pregnant women in South Wollo , Northwest Ethiopia , by involving 819 pregnant women from March to April , 2014 . Data were collected by using pretested interviewer administered questionnaire and analyzed using a computer program of SPSS version 20.00 . Results . Pregnant women who were prepared for at least three elements of BPCR were 24.1 % . Pregnant women knowing at least three key **danger signs ** [T033] during pregnancy , delivery , and postnatal period were 23.2 % , 22.6 % , and 9.6 % , respectively . Women having **secondary education ** [T033] and higher were 6.20 ( 95 % CI = [ 1.36 , 28.120 ] ) times more likely to be prepared than illiterates . Women having a **lifetime history of stillbirth ** [T033] [ 5.80 ( 1.13 , 29.63 ) ] , attending **ANC ** [T058] for last child pregnancy [ 5.44 ( 2.07 , 14.27 ) ] , participating in community BPCR group discussion [ 4.36 ( 1.17 , 16.26 ) ] , and having their male partner involved in **BPCR counseling ** [T058] during **ANC follow - up ** [T058] [ 4.45 ( 1.95 , 10.16 ) ] were more likely to be prepared . Conclusions . BPCR was very low and should be strengthened through **health communication ** [T058] by involving partner in **BPCR counseling ** [T058] . 

A child with **phenylketonuria ** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylketonuria) and **focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_segmental_glomerulosclerosis) , the bright side of **proteinuria ** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteinuria) **Phenylketonuria ** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylketonuria) ( **PKU ** [T047] () ) is the most common **inborn error of ** [T019] amino acid metabolism . Phenylalanine hydroxylase is the underlying deficient enzyme . If left untreated , growth failure , **microcephaly ** [T019] , **global developmental delay ** [T033] , **seizures ** [T184] and severe **intellectual impairment ** [T048] would characterize the clinical picture of **PKU ** [T047] () . On the other side of protein homeostasis lies **nephrotic syndrome ** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotic_syndrome) . It is a well - known quantitative defect due to significant **proteinuria ** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteinuria) . **Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_segmental_glomerulosclerosis) ( **FSGS ** [T047] () ) is a special congenital variant affecting children and adults . Hereby , we describe a three- year old male child who presented with **generalized edema ** [T184] and **global developmental delay ** [T033] . Investigations revealed **PKU ** [T047] () along with **FSGS ** [T047] () . We assume that **congenital nephrosis ** [T019] ameliorated the picture of **PKU ** [T047] () , and had a salutary effect on the growth and development . Such **coexistence ** [T033] between **PKU ** [T047] () and **FSGS ** [T047] () has n't been described before .

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muckle%E2%80%93Wells_syndrome) ) . Yet , a linear linkage between amyloid - β peptide ( Aβ ) and the disease onset and progression has recently been questioned . In this context , the crucial partnership between Aβ and Nrf2 pathways is acquiring paramount importance , offering prospects for deciphering the Aβ -centered disease network . Here , we report on a new class of **antiaggregating agents ** [T121] rationally designed to simultaneously activate transcription -based antioxidant responses , whose **lead 1 ** [T121] showed interesting properties in a preliminary investigation . Relying on the requirements of Aβ recognition , we identified the **catechol derivative 12 ** [T121] . In SH - SY5Y neuroblastoma cells , **12 ** [T121] combined remarkable free radical scavenger properties to the ability to trigger the Nrf2 pathway and induce the Nrf2 - dependent defensive gene NQO1 by means of electrophilic activation of the transcriptional response . Moreover , **12 ** [T121] prevented the formation of cytotoxic stable oligomeric intermediates , being significantly more effective , and per se less toxic , than prototype **12 1 ** [T121] . More importantly , as different chemical features were exploited to regulate Nrf2 and Aβ activities , the two pathways could be tuned independently . These **findings ** [T033] point to **compound 12 ** [T121] and its derivatives as promising tools for investigating the therapeutic potential of the Nrf2 / Aβ cellular network , laying foundation for generating new **drug ** [T121] leads to confront **AD ** [T047] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psoriasis, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula,
